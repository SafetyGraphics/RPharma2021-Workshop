# Excercise 3.1 - Export the code for the hepatic explorer and run the chart as a standalone graphic. Use the same custom data loaded in `Ex2_1.R`

# Bonus - Update the exported code for the hepatic explorer settings to use a custom title. To learn more about custom settings, click "wiki" in the chart header "configuration" and look for settings.title (or just use this link - https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/hep-explorer/wiki/Configuration#settingstitle)
